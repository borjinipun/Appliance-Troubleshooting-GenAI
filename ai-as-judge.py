# AI Judge Framework for E-commerce Content Evaluation

## Project Overview
# This project is a Python framework designed to evaluate and judge the quality of content generated for e-commerce websites. It incorporates the concept of an AI Judge, which assesses and scores the outputs of content-generating AI models (e.g., LLMs) based on criteria like accuracy, tone, helpfulness, and completeness. This framework provides tools for training a judge model, evaluating generated content, and gaining insights into model performance.
